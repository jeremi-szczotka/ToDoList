This is a web-based To-Do List Application built with Flask and connected to a PostgreSQL database.

It allows users to register, log in, and manage personal task lists in a secure and user-friendly environment.

Each user can add, edit, complete, and delete their own tasks.

The app features a responsive interface using Bootstrap 5 and includes a complete Selenium-based test suite for end-to-end functional testing.

Designed with clean architecture and simplicity in mind, this project is ideal for practicing web development fundamentals including Flask routing, user authentication, SQLAlchemy ORM, and automated browser testing.
